        <p id="interesting-fact">The griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) is a large Old World vulture in the bird of prey family
             Accipitridae. It is also known as the Eurasian griffon. It is not to be confused with a different species, 
             RÃ¼ppell's griffon vulture (Gyps rueppellii). It is closely related to the white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus)</p>

        <p id="summary">The eagle is a social bird, it incubates eggs and lives in dwellings 
          in high mountains, which are difficult for predators to reach. The relationship between 
          the spouses in the eagles extends a lifetime, as it seems. The couple begins their courtship 
          at the beginning of winter, when the eagles comb each other and also perform a show flight, 
          during this streamlined flight their wings touch. Eagles' nest is a collection of few branches 
          and mattresses. The female lays only one egg, and the couple shares her bosom. The chick hatches 
          after 55 days of incubation, its eyes are open during hatching and covered with soft white feathers. 
          After more than ten days of complete maintenance, the chick leaves the nest and begins its independent life.
